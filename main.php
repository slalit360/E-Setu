	   E-Governance of the SETU project will ensure that everyone will have access to various documents or certification he needs from the government at the click of a button on a personal computer. All that is required is to submit the hard copy at the SETU Window at the collector's office (for the residents within the limits of Zone) along with the required documentation (also clearly highlighted on the user-friendly website). It is our goal to issue the certificate normally within a span of 5 days.

       The purpose of the website is to make the entire process transparent so that any
       layman can easily follow the step-by-step instructions to get the desired
       certificate hassle-free and on time. SETU ensures the process is convenient,
       faster and fully beneficial to the common man. The SETU website is an initiative
       by this Collectorate to be more responsive to the people's need using today's
       Information Technology (IT). SETU has built the bridge. Use it. And help
       us to help you better. The motto of SETU says it perfectly - 'Sevetun Samadhaan'
       which means Satisfaction through Service.
